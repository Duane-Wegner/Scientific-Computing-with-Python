# Certification Projects â€” Scientific Computing with Python

This folder contains certification projects built during my progress in the [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification by freeCodeCamp. These projects were required for certification and were designed to reinforce Python programming concepts through hands-on practice.
