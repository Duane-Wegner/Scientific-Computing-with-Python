# Non-Certification Projects — Scientific Computing with Python

This folder contains projects built during my progress in the [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification by freeCodeCamp. These mini-projects were not required for certification but were designed to reinforce key Python programming concepts through hands-on practice.

## Project List

Below is a list of projects organized by Section.

### [**Section 1**](./Section%201)
- [**Use Lambda Functions: Build an Expense Tracker**](./Section%201/Expense%20Tracker)
  - A simple command-line program that helps you track, categorize, and summarize expenses using Python. Built as part of freeCodeCamp’s lambda function curriculum, this project puts core concepts of functional programming and list manipulation into practice.
- [**Python List Comprehension: Case Converter**](./Section%201/Case%20Converter)
  - This project converts strings written in PascalCase or camelCase into snake_case. It's a clean, expressive example of how to use list comprehension, conditional expressions, and string manipulation in Python to build practical tools that align with naming conventions in Python and beyond.
- [**Learn String Manipulation by Building a Cipher**](./Section%201/cipher)
  - This project walks through the fundamentals of encryption using Python. It introduces two classical cipher systems, Caesar Cipher and Vigenère Cipher, alongside a practical exploration of string manipulation, control flow, and functional programming.
- [**Work with Numbers and Strings: Luhn Algorithm**](./Section%201/Luhn%20Algo)
  - This Python script checks whether a given credit card number is valid using the Luhn algorithm—a checksum formula used to validate identification numbers such as credit card numbers.
- [**Bisection Method: Square Root Finder**](./Section%201/Find%20the%20Square%20Root%20of%20a%20Number)
  - This project implements the bisection method to approximate the square root of a non-negative number using pure Python. It’s a clear and methodical demonstration of numerical methods applied in scientific computing, designed to reinforce concepts from freeCodeCamp’s Scientific Computing with Python curriculum.

### [**Section 2**](./Section%202)
- [**Build a Password Generator Using Regular Expressions**](./Section%202/Password%20Generator)
  - This project puts regular expressions and secure randomness to work by generating customizable passwords with specific character constraints. You'll explore how to combine cryptography and validation logic to create robust, criteria-based outputs.
- [**Algorithm Design: Shortest Path Algorithm**](./Section%202/Shortest%20Path)
  - This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between nodes in a weighted graph.
- [**Recursion: Tower of Hanoi**](./Section%202/Tower%20of%20Hanoi%20Puzzle)
- [**Sorting: Merge Sort Algorithm**](./Section%202/Merge%20Sort%20Algo)

### Section 3
- **Classes and Objects: Sudoku Solver**
- **Tree Traversal: Binary Search Tree**

### Section 4
- **Special Methods: Vector Space**
- **Interfaces: Equation Solver**

### Section 5
- **Encapsulation: Projectile Trajectory Calculator**
