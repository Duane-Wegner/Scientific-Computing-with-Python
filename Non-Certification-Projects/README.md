# Non-Certification Projects — Scientific Computing with Python

This folder contains projects built during my progress in the [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification by freeCodeCamp. These mini-projects were not required for certification but were designed to reinforce key Python programming concepts through hands-on practice.

## Project List

Below is a list of projects included in this certification, organized by topic:

### Core Python Concepts
- [ ] **Build an Arithmetic Formatter** – Format arithmetic problems vertically.
- [x] [**Learn String Manipulation by Building a Cipher**](./Non-Certification-Projects/Section%201/cipher)
- [x] [**Work with Numbers and Strings: Luhn Algorithm**](./Non-Certification-Projects/Section%201/Luhn%20Algo)
- [ ] **Build a Password Generator Using Regular Expressions**

### Functional Programming
- [x] [**Use Lambda Functions: Build an Expense Tracker**](./Non-Certification-Projects/Section%201/Expense%20Tracker)
- [x] [**Python List Comprehension: Case Converter**](./Non-Certification-Projects/Section%201/Case%20Converter)

### Numerical Methods & Algorithms
- [x] [**Bisection Method: Square Root Finder**](./Non-Certification-Projects/Section%201/Find%20the%20Square%20Root%20of%20a%20Number)
- [ ] **Algorithm Design: Shortest Path Algorithm**
- [ ] **Recursion: Tower of Hanoi**
- [ ] **Sorting: Merge Sort Algorithm**

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- [ ] **Build a Time Calculator**
- [ ] **Build a Budget App**
- [ ] **Build a Polygon Area Calculator**
- [ ] **Build a Probability Calculator**
- [ ] **Classes and Objects: Sudoku Solver**
- [ ] **Encapsulation: Projectile Trajectory Calculator**
- [ ] **Special Methods: Vector Space**
- [ ] **Interfaces: Equation Solver**
- [ ] **Tree Traversal: Binary Search Tree**

## Purpose

These projects help reinforce:
- Python syntax and core data structures
- Functional patterns like mapping and filtering
- Clean, readable, and modular code design
- Conceptual bridges between computer science and real-world applications

They also give me space to experiment, debug, and deepen my understanding of how Python works under the hood.
