# Non-Certification Projects â€” Scientific Computing with Python

This folder contains projects built during my progress in the [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification by freeCodeCamp. These mini-projects were not required for certification but were designed to reinforce key Python programming concepts through hands-on practice.
