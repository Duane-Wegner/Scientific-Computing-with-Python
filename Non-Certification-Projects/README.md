# Non-Certification Projects — Scientific Computing with Python

This folder contains projects built during my progress in the [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification by freeCodeCamp. These mini-projects were not required for certification but were designed to reinforce key Python programming concepts through hands-on practice.

## Project List

Below is a list of projects included in this certification course that were not required to get the certification, organized by Section:

### Section 1
- [x] [**Use Lambda Functions: Build an Expense Tracker**](./Expense%20Tracker)  
  Functional programming using `lambda`, `map()`, and `filter()` to categorize expenses from user input.

- [x] [**Python List Comprehension: Case Converter**](./Case%20Converter)  
  A small utility that converts PascalCase or camelCase into snake_case using a single list comprehension.

- [x] [**Learn String Manipulation by Building a Cipher**](./cipher)  
  Implements Caesar and Vigenère ciphers to demonstrate modular arithmetic, shifting, and keyword encoding.

- [x] [**Work with Numbers and Strings: Luhn Algorithm**](./Luhn%20Algo)  
  Validates numeric strings using the Luhn checksum — common in credit card number validation.

- [x] [**Bisection Method: Square Root Finder**](./Find%20the%20Square%20Root%20of%20a%20Number)  
  Approximates the square root of a non-negative number using the bisection root-finding algorithm.

### Section 2
- [ ] **Build a Password Generator Using Regular Expressions**
