# Non-Certification Projects â€” Scientific Computing with Python

This folder contains bonus projects built alongside my progress in the [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification by freeCodeCamp. These mini-projects were not required for certification but were designed to reinforce key Python programming concepts through hands-on practice.

## Included Projects

### Case Converter
Convert PascalCase or camelCase strings into snake_case using list comprehensions and conditional logic.

- Focus: String manipulation, list comprehensions, `join()`, and ternary expressions
- Skills practiced: `.isupper()`, `.lower()`, `strip('_')`, readability

### Expense Tracker
A command-line app for recording, filtering, and totaling categorized expenses.

- Focus: Functional programming using `lambda`, `map()`, and `filter()`
- Skills practiced: Higher-order functions, data collection, CLI interaction

### Luhn Algorithm Validator
Implements the Luhn algorithm to validate credit card numbers.

- Focus: Control flow, digit manipulation, and checksum logic
- Skills practiced: List slicing, conditionals, string reversal, modulus math

### Cipher Lab
Explore classical encryption techniques with Caesar and VigenÃ¨re ciphers.

- Focus: Modular arithmetic, string iteration, and algorithmic thinking
- Skills practiced: Looping, lowercase normalization, keyword-based offsetting

## Purpose

These projects help reinforce:
- Python syntax and core data structures
- Functional patterns like mapping and filtering
- Clean, readable, and modular code design
- Conceptual bridges between computer science and real-world applications

They also give me space to experiment, debug, and deepen my understanding of how Python works under the hood.
