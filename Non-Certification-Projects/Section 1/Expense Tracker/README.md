# Expense Tracker - Python CLI App

A simple command-line program that helps you **track, categorize, and summarize expenses** using Python. Built as part of freeCodeCampâ€™s lambda function curriculum, this project puts core concepts of functional programming and list manipulation into practice.

## What This Teaches

### Python Fundamentals
- How to work with lists and dictionaries to manage structured data
- How to define and reuse functions (`add_expense()`, `total_expenses()`, etc.)
- How to build a user-friendly `while` loop menu with input handling

### Functional Programming
- Using `lambda` functions for quick operations
- Using `map()` to transform data
- Using `filter()` to extract subsets of data

### Program Design
- Modular structure with a dedicated `main()` function
- Clear separation of responsibilities across helper functions
- Descriptive output for usability and testing

## How to Use

1. **Run the script** in any Python 3 environment:
   ```bash
   Expense-Tracker_lambdaFunctions.py
2. Choose an option from the menu:

    Add an expense (amount + category)

    View all recorded expenses

    Show total amount spent

    Filter expenses by category

    Exit the program

3. Data is stored in memory, so each session starts fresh (for now).

## Future Ideas
Store expenses in a CSV or JSON file for persistence

Add date tracking to each entry

Visualize categories and totals using a charting library
