## The following section contains 

### Core Python Concepts
- [**Learn String Manipulation by Building a Cipher**](./cipher)
  - This project walks through the fundamentals of encryption using Python. It introduces two classical cipher systems, Caesar Cipher and Vigenère Cipher, alongside a practical exploration of string manipulation, control flow, and functional programming.
- [**Work with Numbers and Strings: Luhn Algorithm**](./Luhn%20Algo)
  - This Python script checks whether a given credit card number is valid using the Luhn algorithm—a checksum formula used to validate identification numbers such as credit card numbers.

### Functional Programming
- [**Use Lambda Functions: Build an Expense Tracker**](./Expense%20Tracker)
  - A simple command-line program that helps you track, categorize, and summarize expenses using Python. Built as part of freeCodeCamp’s lambda function curriculum, this project puts core concepts of functional programming and list manipulation into practice.
- [**Python List Comprehension: Case Converter**](./Case%20Converter)
  - This project converts strings written in PascalCase or camelCase into snake_case. It's a clean, expressive example of how to use list comprehension, conditional expressions, and string manipulation in Python to build practical tools that align with naming conventions in Python and beyond.

### Numerical Methods & Algorithms
- [**Bisection Method: Square Root Finder**](./Find%20the%20Square%20Root%20of%20a%20Number)
  - This project implements the bisection method to approximate the square root of a non-negative number using pure Python. It’s a clear and methodical demonstration of numerical methods applied in scientific computing, designed to reinforce concepts from freeCodeCamp’s Scientific Computing with Python curriculum.
