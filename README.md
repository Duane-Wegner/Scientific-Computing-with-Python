# Scientific Computing with Python freeCodeCamp Certification

This repository contains my solutions to the projects from the [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification offered by freeCodeCamp. The course covers core programming concepts in Python and introduces important computational and algorithmic techniques used in scientific programming.

4. [ ] Polygon Area Calculator
5. [ ] Probability Calculator

Once all certification projects are completed and submitted, the official **Scientific Computing with Python Certification** will be issued by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Tech Stack

- Language: **Python 3.x**
- IDEs: PyCharm, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Replit (optional)
- Dependencies: None (Standard Library only)

## Goals
By the end of this course, I will have:

- Strengthened my Python programming fundamentals

- Gained hands-on experience with algorithms and numerical methods

- Improved my understanding of Object-Oriented Design in Python

- Built a strong foundation for further learning in data science and machine learning

- This certification is part of my learning journey through freeCodeCamp’s self-paced curriculum. I’m committed to writing clean, readable, and well-documented code.
